A website made with pyscript, utilizing OpenAI's GPT3 API.
This took me a while to make, intially I wanted for it to be a project to be done in a few days but oops it's now 1500+ lines, I had to explore a lot of barely charted grounds with Pyscript and making it work with OpenAI.

## Important:
Sadly my project has to use old GPT 3 models instead of moder GPT 3.5 and 4 because openai module is not yet supported on Pyodide since Pyscript and Pyodide are very new. You can however speed up this process by bumping more attention to this issue on their repo: 
[OpenAI module request](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3588)

Also a few parts of the  code are obfuscated to prevent people from cheesing the prompt limit if you have any doubts of its legitimacy or something just contact me.

## Some of the code is yoinked from:

This should from my knowledge be easily possible in Node.js and Django I just took a weird route.
