A website made with pyscript, utilizing OpenAI's GPT3 API.
This took me a few days and a lot of trial and error to make, I had to explore some barely charted grounds with Pyscript and making it work with OpenAI.

### A lot of the code is yoinked from:
[Medium article](https://medium.com/@ivancampos) by Ivan Campos

This should from my knowledge be easily possible in Node.js and Django I just took a weird route.

## Important:
Sadly my project has to use old GPT 3 models instead of moder GPT 3.5 and 4 because openai module is not yet supported on Pyodite since Pyscript and Pyodite are very new. You can however speed up this process by bumping more attention to this issue on their repo: 
[OpenAI module request](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3588)

Also a few parts of the  code are obfuscated to prevent people from cheesing the prompt limit if you have any doubts of its legitimacy or something just contact me.
